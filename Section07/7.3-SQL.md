## Like - pattern matching

``` sql

select StudentName 
	from Students s
	where s.StudentName like 'm%';

select StudentName 
	from Students s
	where s.StudentName like '%n';

# SQLite GLOB

I doubt anyone will need this - and it is only implemented in SQLite:

``` sql

SELECT 1 where 'Mariah' GLOB 'm%';

SELECT 1 where 'Mariah' LIKE 'm%';


```

GLOB is case sensitive and uses Unix style wildcards.

---

# Using Where ... And

``` sql

select s.StudentName
	,s.StudentId
	from Students s
		where s.StudentID > 5
			and s.StudentName like 'm%';
			
```

---

# Using Where ... Or

``` sql

select s.StudentName
	,s.StudentId
	from Students s
		where s.StudentID > 5
			or s.StudentName like 'm%'

```

---

# Use parenthesis in your where clauses


``` sql

select s.StudentName
	,s.StudentId
	from Students s
		where s.StudentID > 5
			and s.StudentName like 'm%'
			or s.StudentName like 's%'
			
```

---

 Might not be what you are looking for...

``` sql 


select s.StudentName
	,s.StudentId
	from Students s
		where s.StudentID > 5
			and (s.StudentName like 'm%'
			or s.StudentName like 's%');

```

---

# Filtering based on a range of values

``` sql 

select s.StudentName as "Student Name"
	,c.SubjectName as "Class"
	,g.Grade as 'Result'
	from Grades g
		inner join Students s
			on g.StudentId = s.StudentId
		inner join Subjects C --classes
			on g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
	where g.Grade between 80 and 90;

```

Most MS SQL Server coders frown on this practice because the boundaries are included.

---

# Try this instead

``` sql 

select s.StudentName as "Student Name"
	,c.SubjectName as "Class"
	,g.Grade as 'Result'
	from Grades g
		inner join Students s
			on g.StudentId = s.StudentId
		inner join Subjects C --classes
			on g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
	where g.Grade >= 80 
		and g.Grade <= 90;

```

This code is more easily read and understood - your future self will thank you.

# Cherry Picking records with Where ... In

``` sql

select * 
	from Students s
	where s.StudentId in (3,5,7,9)
	
```

---

# Where exists

``` sql 

select * 
	from Students s
	where exists (
		select 1 
			from Grades g 
			where s.StudentId = g.StudentId 
			);

```

Notice the "1" - why do you think I wrote the query this way?
This is a bit convoluted - using a join for this is far more efficient 

---

# Inner Join instead of where ... exisits

``` sql

select distinct s.* 
	from Students s
	inner join Grades g
		on s.StudentId = g.StudentId;

```

Let's discuss "distinct"

---

# Using NOT

- NOT BETWEEN 10 and 20 
	- returns all of the rows outside of the range 
- NOT LIKE  'a%'
	- returns all of the rows where the selected column starts with something other than 'a'
- NOT EXISTS
	- Returns all of the rows where a matching record is not found

---

# Where not exists

## Let's say we need to know how many inactive students we have:

``` sql 

select * 
	from Students s
	where not exists (
		select 1 
			from Grades g 
			where s.StudentId = g.StudentId 
			);

```

This is my primary use for NOT and Exists - this pattern can be used to insert only records that I have not already inserted. 

---

# Sorting Data

## It is time for graduation and we need to call our students alphabetically

``` sql 

select s.StudentName
	from Students s
	order by s.StudentName

```

---

# Too many students 
We just need those attending classes.

``` sql

SELECT DISTINCT s.StudentName
	FROM Students s
		INNER JOIN Grades g
			ON s.StudentId = g.StudentId
	ORDER BY s.StudentName

```

Notice the use of distinct again. 
Could be done with where exists.

---

# Let's announce the students in order by grade

``` sql 

SELECT s.StudentName
	,avg(g.grade) AS GPA 
	FROM Students s
		INNER JOIN Grades g
			ON s.StudentId = g.StudentId
	GROUP BY s.StudentName
	ORDER BY avg(g.grade) desc

```

---

# Let's review a bit

When you mix columns with aggregate functions like AVG() all none aggregated columns must be in the GROUP BY clause.
Where Excel has functions that operate on a cell SQL has functions that operate on all of the columns in a result set. 

## Questions?

---

# SQLite Aggregate Function List

- AVG( )
- COUNT( )
- MAX( )
- MIN( )
- SUM( )

---

# Simple pivot

## GROUP_CONCAT(expression, separator)

``` sql 

SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(studentname, '-') FROM Students

```

Can you think of where you might use something like this?

---

# How about in a list of class that the student is enrolled in?

``` sql 

SELECT s.StudentName
	,GROUP_CONCAT(c.SubjectName,' - ')
	FROM Students s
		INNER JOIN Grades g 
			ON s.StudentId = g.StudentId
		INNER JOIN Subjects c 
			ON g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
	GROUP BY s.StudentName


```

---

# Setting Limits

When working with really large datasets it can be VERY helpful to tell SQL to return only a portion of the result set. 

``` sql

--Just give me the first 5 rows
SELECT * 
	FROM Students LIMIT 5;

--Just give me the second five rows
SELECT * 
	FROM Students LIMIT 5,5;

--Rows after the first three
SELECT * 
	FROM Students LIMIT 5 OFFSET 3 

```

---

# Using the Case Statement

``` sql

SELECT s.StudentName
	,GROUP_CONCAT(c.SubjectName,' - ') as Classes
	, CASE WHEN g.Grade IS NULL
		THEN 'Enrolled' 
		ELSE 'Graduated' 
		END as StudentStatus
	FROM Students s
		INNER JOIN Grades g 
			ON s.StudentId = g.StudentId
		INNER JOIN Subjects c 
			ON g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
	GROUP BY s.StudentName
```
