# Some things to ponder
1. Where are the relationships?
2. Does the word intersection mean anything in this context?
3. Why doesn't the Grades table have a primary key
	1. What makes this table special?
	2. Could / Should it have a primary key

# Testing your tables:

``` sql

select * from Departments; 

select * from Subjects;

select * from Students;

select * from Grades;

```

# Updating data

Stephen only let's his mom call him that... we need to change his name to Steve.

``` sql

select * from students;

```


What is his id number in your system? In mine he is 4.

``` sql

update students set StudentName = 'Steve' where StudentId = 4;

```

Rerun your query - did his name get changed?

# Dropped class

Brandon isn't cutting it in the Jazz class and has decided to drop.

``` sql

delete from grades where StudentId = 3 and SubjectId = 9;

```


---

# Changing a Table Definition

``` sql

alter table Subjects add column CreditHours Int;

update subjects set CreditHours = 3 where SubjectId <> 10;

select * from subjects;

alter table Subjects drop column CreditHours;

```

# Making results Human friendly

So far we have been content using the computer friendly id columns to work through our examples. 

Let's take a look at a better way of working with query results.

In the example earlier with the dropped class you really needed to trust me that the keys were correct, right? If you entered your data manually then the keys may have been wrong. Let's take a look at making queries friendlier.

## Welcome to inner joins 

``` sql

select * 
	from Grades g
	inner join Students s
		on g.StudentId = s.StudentId
	inner join Subjects C --classes
		on g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
		;

```


---

# Can we make this better?

``` sql

select s.StudentName
	,c.SubjectName
	,g.Grade 
	from Grades g
	inner join Students s
		on g.StudentId = s.StudentId
	inner join Subjects c --classes
		on g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
		;

```

---

# Maybe one more tweak

``` sql


select s.StudentName as "Student Name"
	,c.SubjectName as "Class"
	,g.Grade as 'Result'
	from Grades g
	inner join Students s
		on g.StudentId = s.StudentId
	inner join Subjects C --classes
		on g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
		;

```

# Review

The last query looks pretty good, right? Easy to read, has just what makes sense to the humans. But what if we want all students regardless of enrollment in a class?

## Welcome to left joins

``` sql

select s.StudentName as "Student Name"
	,c.SubjectName as "Class"
	,g.Grade as 'Result'
	from Students s
		left join Grades g
			on s.StudentId = g.StudentId
		left join Subjects C --classes
			on g.SubjectId = c.SubjectId
		;


```

# What about RIGHT joins?

## Just don't
- Your future self will never forgive you if you right a query with both left and right joins
- I almost never see right joins in the wild
- Technical Debt is real - some say code is a liability. 
- Venn Diagrams.

# Wrap up

We covered a ton tonight! Thank you for hanging in there. 

There is no homework for you to turn in for tonight but I encourage you to test your skills with joins and write queries for some other things the school might want to know. 

Like:
- What is a student's average grade
- What department has the highest average grade
- What student has the single highest grade

See you tomorrow!
