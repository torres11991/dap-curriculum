# 6. Python Homework

## Arrays and Array Methods

Create a file and name it 6-Homework (this can be a Python file or a Jupyter Notebook file)

<br>

1. Create an if statement: if 'age' is greater than or equal to 25, print "Renting a car is more affordable", however if 'age' is less than 25, print "Renting a car is very expensive."

2. Create and chain an if-else  statement: if 'age' is greater than or equal to 25, print "Renting a car is more affordable." If 'age' is less than 25 but greater than or equal to 18, print "Renting a car is very expensive." Finally, if age is less than 18, print "You cannot legally rent a car."

3. Loop over the following string to (1) count all the characters in the string and print out all the vowels -- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

4. Write a nested loop that prints out every piece of clothing from the `couture` list, in every fashionable color from the `panettone` set: couture = ["trousers", "blouse", "bandana", "cumber band", "blazer", "vest", "french beret", "scarf", "stole"] and panettone = {"cerise", "fuchsia", "aqua", "maple", "auburn", "burnt sienna", "gunmetal blue", "Dark Sapphire"}

5. Use range as a loop to calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100

6. Print the second item in this fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

7. Change the value from "apple" to "kiwi", in the fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

8. Use the append method to add "orange" to the fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

9. Use the insert method to add "lemon" as the second item in the fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

10. Use the remove method to remove "banana" from the fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

11. Use negative indexing to print the 3rd and 2nd to last items in the list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

12. Use a range of indexes to print the third, fourth, and fifth item in the list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

13. Use the correct syntax to print the number of items in the list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

14. Use the correct syntax to sort this list in reverse order
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

15. Use the DateTime module to get Current Date and Time, and save it to a variable. Then extract just the month name form that variable.

16. Write a simple function that takes 2 parameters -- a  first name and a day name.
    - Set a default value for the day name of Sunday.
    - Have the function print out a greeting -- using the parameters -- that says something like "Hi first-name! Happy day-name!". Remember to use the variables in the greeting to replace first-name and day-name.  
    - Invoke this function with 2 variables.
    - Invoke this function with 1 variable only.

17. Import NumPy and create an array with a shape of ... (2, 3, 2)

18. Use NumPy `.linspace()` to create an array with 6 linearly spaced values between 0 and 20

19. Make a Deep Copy of the above array you created.

20. What are 2 reasons we use NumPy over Python Lists
