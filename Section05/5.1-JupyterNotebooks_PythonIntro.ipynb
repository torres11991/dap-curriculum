    "## Why Data Analytics and Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Well, what is a Programer?\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer programmer or a coder, is a person who creates computer programs — often to solve large problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, a programer is a creator, a problem solver, and a thinker.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### And what is an Data Analyst?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Data Analyst conducts research and analyzes collected data to find patterns, trends, and insights that can help answer questions in decision-making and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So at the heart of it an analyst is also a thinker, a problem solver, and a creator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is why Programing and Data Analysis fit together so well!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### And that is what we'll learn in this cohort\n",
    "-   We'll learn to think methodically\n",
    "-   How to create small programs to apply your coding skills\n",
    "-   And how to answer questions that solve problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Programs and Algorithms?\n",
    "-   An algorithm is a series of steps to solve a problem at hand\n",
    "-   A program is a series of instructions telling a computer how to solve a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "If we put this all together, then programming is the skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent that solution in a program that can be followed by a computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are written in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C# etc.\n"

    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is considered a high-level language.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs must be processed before they can be run by a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The languages that are most easily understood by computers are the \"lowest level languages\" known as **Machine Languages**. These Machine Languages decode instructions into binary code that is easily interpreted and executed by computer hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "While computers love low-level / machine languages, for us humans, it's easier to use a high-level coding language.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level coding languages are more like natural languages\n",
    "-   they take less time to write\n",
    "-   they are shorter and easier to read\n",
    "-   and they are more likely to be correct/error free when we run them\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback with High-level languages is that they need to be \"translated\" into machine language for computers to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are two \"ways\" computers Process/Translate Program Code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 general classes of coding languages --  `Interpreted` languages amd `Compiled` languages\n",
    "\n",
    "With **Interpreted Languages**, an interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning it does what the program says. Interpreters processes programs a little bit at a time, reading lines and performing computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **Compiled Languages**, a Compiler reads the whole program at once, and then translates it completely into machine code, before starting to run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is an Interpreted language\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code of a Python program is 'interpreted' a bit at a time, and converted into `byteCode`, that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is different from major compiled languages, such as Java, C# and C++; Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally there are two classes of languages, `Natural` Languages and `Formal` Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Languages** are mostly spoken languages that form on their own. Slang is a great example of a natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Languages** are designed by people. Programming languages fall under this category. For these languages there are formal rules about grammar, syntax, and punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to be learning all about the formal grammar, syntax, and punctuation of the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Programing Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VALUE** -- a number or string etc. that can be stored in a variable or computed in an expression\n",
    "- **VARIABLE** -- a name that refers to a value\n",
    "- **VARIABLE NAME** -- A name given to a variable. Variable names consist of a sequence of letters and digits that begin with a letter. “In best programming practice\", variable names should describe their use in a program, making the program self documenting\n",
    "- **str** -- a Python data type that holds a string of characters\n",
    "- **Operators** -- are special symbols that represent a simple computation\n",
    "- **Data Type** -- a set of values\n",
    "- **Comment** -- information in a program that is meant for other programmers and for your future-self (used with `#` in front)\n",
    "- **Input** -- a command in a program that prompts the user to put in an answer\n",
    "- **Output** -- the result of a program\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Learning Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python class materials we'll use are based on an open-source training program called **\"Python For Everyone\"** -- PY4E.\n",
    "- The PY4E program was created by Dr. Charles Severance (a.k.a. Dr. Chuck)\n",
    "- He’s a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information Technology\n",
    "- The [PY4E website](https://www.py4e.com/) at https://www.py4e.com/ is loaded with additional training materials we recommend you use in parallel with this cohort\n",

    "### Different ways to code Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to code Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One can code and run Python code in an 'Integrated Development Environment' (IDE). We will use the VS Code IDE to do most of our coding. We will get to this a little later.\n",
    "- Python also comes with a built-in command-line interpreter where one can run Python commands and execute Python files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Python Integrated Interpreter**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to start working with Python is in an interactive **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)** environment. That simply means starting up the interpreter and typing commands to it directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter:\n",
    "-   **Reads** the command you enter\n",
    "-   **Evaluates** and executes the command\n",
    "-   **Prints** the output (if any) to the console\n",
    "-   **Loops** back and repeats the process\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Terminal Exercise: -**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In your terminal, type the command \"`python`\". Note that for MacOS users the command is \"`python3`\".\n",
    "-   The python interpreter should open and display an image like this one below...\n",
    "\n",
    "![Integrated Python Shell](./images/python_shell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The terminal should return something like the following response:- \n",
    "\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Type in the command \"`help()`\". The terminal should display a message like the one below...\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python terminal help command](./images/python_shell_Help.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the \"help>\" prompt type the command `keywords` and observe the response. You should see a list of Python reserved keywords (more about these later)\n",
    "- To quit this help utility and return to the interpreter, just type the command `quit` at the \"help>\" prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next, let's execute the statement that displays \"Hello, World!\" to the console:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Ensure that the >>> prompt is displayed, and the cursor is positioned after it\n",
    "-   Type the command `print(\"Hello, World!\")` exactly as shown, and enter\n",
    "-   The interpreter’s response should appear on the next line. You can tell it is console output because the >>> prompt is absent:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hello World](./images/python_helloWorld.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your session looks like the above, then you have executed your first Python code! Take a moment to celebrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished coding with the interpreter, you can exit the REPL session by typing `exit()` and pressing enter, or by pressing the `Ctrl+z` keys together.\n",

    "- **LOGICAL errors** –when instructions given do not accomplish the intended goal. EG: wrong calculations\n",

    "\n",
