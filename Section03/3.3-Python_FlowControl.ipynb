    "The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.\n",

    "The power of a language like Python comes largely from the variety of ways these basic statements can be combined.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Sequential** - Sequential statements are a set of statements whose execution process happens in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection** - selection statements are also known as Decision control statements or branching statements. This allows a program to test several conditions and execute instructions based on which condition is true.\n",

    "`Sequential statements` are a set of statements whose execution process happens in a sequence. This is the default mode for code execution in Python -- one after another lines of code are executed, from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are rarely linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programs do not work by executing a simple sequential set of statements. The code is constructed so that decisions can be made, and different pathways can be taken through the program, based on changes in variable values.\n",

    "The selection statement allows a program to test several conditions and execute instructions based on which condition is true. In other words, a decision is made based on some condition, and the program execution code veers off in a specific direction, like a fork in a road.\n",
