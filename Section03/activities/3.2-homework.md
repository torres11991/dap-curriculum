# 5.3 Python Homework

## Advanced / Compound Data Types

1. Create a file and name it 5_3-Homework (this can be a Python file or a Jupyter Notebook file)

<br>

2. Create a list of at least 5 elements of mixed data types
    - replace a part of it with something else
    - append or insert several more items to the list
    - find and print the length of the list
    - slice a sub-section of the 1st list, and save it to a different 2nd list
    - print the 2nd list
    - extend your original list with the 2nd list sliced above
    - Create a new list called "simList" containing at least 5 elements of the same data type, either string, integer, float, or Boolean.
    - sort "simList", and print the list
    - copy the "simList" list to another 3rd list
    - add the 2nd and 3rd lists together into a 4th list

<br>

3. Create a tuple of about 5 elements
    - multiply your tuple by 3 and save it to a new 2nd tuple
    - access and print the 12th element from the 2nd tuple
    - sort the 2nd tuple and print it
    - copy 4 specific elements from your 2nd tuple to a new 3nd tuple
    - unpack the 3rd tuple into 4 variables and print these variables
    - create a 4th tuple with single item 50 and print this tuple
    - add the 2nd and 3rd tuple together into a 5th tuple and print the tuple

<br>

4. Create a set of about 3 elements
    - add a list of fruits to the above set and print the result
    - add a car element to your set
    - create a 2nd set with a few odd items
    - save the union of 1st set and 2nd set to a 3rd set
    - pop an element from the 2nd set, and print the remainder of the set
    - clear the 1st set and print the result
    - discard an element, and remove another element from the 3rd set
    - print the remainder of the 3rd set

<br>

5. Create a dictionary with at least 5 values of different data types
    - print out 1 value
    - replace any one value in your dictionary with your name
    - add your favorite color to the dictionary
    - add a list, tuple or set to your dictionary
    - print a list of the dictionary keys
    - print a list of the dictionary values
    - copy your 1st dictionary into a 2nd dictionary
    - pop an item from the 2nd dictionary, and print the dictionary
    - remove all the elements from the 2nd dictionary and print the result

6. Save your file in your homework folder, and push it to GitHub.
    - Once you have completed all your homework for the week, create a ticket to let the TAs know you have completed it.
    - Remember to add the link to you homework, to the ticket.
