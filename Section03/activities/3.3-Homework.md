# 3.3 Python Homework

## Flow Control Methods

Create a file and name it 3.3-Homework (this can be a Python file or a Jupyter Notebook file)

1. Create an if statement: if 'age' is greater than or equal to 25, print "Renting a car is more affordable", however if 'age' is less than 25, print "Renting a car is very expensive."

2. Create and chain an if-else  statement: if 'age' is greater than or equal to 25, print "Renting a car is more affordable." If 'age' is less than 25 but greater than or equal to 18, print "Renting a car is very expensive." Finally, if age is less than 18, print "You cannot legally rent a car."

3. Loop over the following string to (1) count all the characters in the string and (2) print out all the vowels -- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

4. Write a nested loop that prints out every piece of clothing from the `couture` list, in every fashionable color from the `panettone` set: couture = ["trousers", "blouse", "bandana", "cumber band", "blazer", "vest", "french beret", "scarf", "stole"] and panettone = {"cerise", "fuchsia", "aqua", "maple", "auburn", "burnt sienna", "gunmetal blue", "Dark Sapphire"}

5. Use range as a loop to calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100

6. Print the second item in this fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

7. Change the value from "apple" to "kiwi", in the fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

8. Use the append method to add "orange" to the fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

9. Use the insert method to add "lemon" as the second item in the fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

10. Use the remove method to remove "banana" from the fruits list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

11. Use negative indexing to print the 3rd and 2nd to last items in the list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

12. Use a range of indexes to print the third, fourth, and fifth item in the list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

13. Use the correct syntax to print the number of items in the list.
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

14. Use the correct syntax to sort this list in reverse order
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
