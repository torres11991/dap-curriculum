# Sprint Planning Points

## Use Lucid Chart to Draw a database diagram

1. Create a free Lucid Chart Account
1. Run the Lucid Chart ERD query against your database
1. Import your database schema to Lucid Chart
1. Connect the tables
1. Export your ERD as a PDF and sumbit it as your assignment

## Create mapping tables to describe your data

1. Some of our data is represented with ids only. Let's create mapping tables to translate the ids to labels.
1. There will be a task here for each table - TBD

## Export cleaned data to csv for use in a reporting tool

1. Describe what fact you have learned that you find most interesting
1. Translate your finding into a SQL select statement that creates a table you can use to build a report
1. Export your data as a csv file
1. Re-import your file to a new table to test for any issues that may make your new dataset difficult to work with.
