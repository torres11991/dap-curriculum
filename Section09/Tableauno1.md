## DATA VISUALIZATION WITH TABLEAU

- Can utilize data in various forms (except for Tableau Public)
- No technical or programming experience required
- You can data blend (connect multiple sources for one analysis using joins)
- Analyze in real-time
- Collaborate with other team members

### Advantages

- Scripting language
- Data VIsualization
- Quick Insights
- Large amounts of data
- Easy Implementation
- Responsive Dashboard

### Disadvantages

- Restrictive Imports
- Custom Formatting
- Static Parameter
- Screen Resolution
- Scheduling Reports

---

### Tableau Public

Can load from 9 different data sources

### Tableau Desktop

Can load from 77 different data sources

---

### OPENING TABLEAU PUBLIC

1. CONNECT PANE: where various data sources can be connected
2. OPEN PANE: where you can see recently opened files/sample dashboards
3. DISCOVER PANE: helps you connect with the Tableau Community and access videos and blogs.
        
        CLICK ON MICROSOFT EXCEL 
         >>> OPEN SAMPLE - SUPERSTORE
                CLICK/DRAG 'ORDERS' OVER TO 
                        THE WHITE AREA ON THE RIGHT

---

### TABLEAU BREAKDOWN

- Each graph should require a NEW worksheet & make sure they are named properly
- Dashboards are "preps" for your STORY (aka presentation) 
- Think of each Dashboard as a “slide” where you put your STORY together. Make sure to name them properly
- Your STORY is your presentation of how you want to show your Dashboards (aka slides)

### LET'S PRACTICE

1. Plot SALES against CATEGORY, SEGMENT & ORDER DATE
2. Make it a line graph
3. Filter down to Home Office for each segment
4. Delete the title above the graph
5. Convert the graph a bar graph
6. Rename the bar graph “Home Office Sales”

### 8 TOOLS TO PREPARE DATA FOR ANALYSIS

- JOINS
- RELATIONSHPS 
- UNIONS
- DATA BLEANDING
- AGGREGATIONS
- PIVOT
- DATA INTERPRETER
- SPLIT

### JOINS

Combine data in order to filter and get rid of duplicates

- Left Join
- Right Join
- Inner Join
- Full Outer Join

1. Connect to the Super-Store dataset
2. Move "Orders' and click Open
3. Right-click on "Orders' and click Open
4. Move "Returns" over to the canvas
        - This creates an inner join BY DEFAULT
5. Select the correct join

Tableau will identify the primary key for joining two or more data sets together

- Left Join: values from LEFT Table & match to RIGHT Table
- Right Join: values from RIGHT Table & match to LEFT Table
- Inner Join: includes common data present in BOTH datasets
- Full Outer Join: includes ALL values from both tables

### RELATIONSHIPS

- Created when you drag more than one sheet over
- Think of it as a contract between two tables
- No joining
- Automatic & context aware
- Flexible

---

## JOINS vs RELATIONSHIPS

### UNIONS

Helps bring together data from multiple small files into one large one.

1. Connect to dataset
2. Drag over needed sheet
3. Drag over another to overlap (you'll see "union")
4. Overlapping icon

### Data Blending

Tableau combines related data from multiple sources in a single view

1. Connect two sources (Superstore & Global Superstore)
2. Click on Data table & "Edit Blend Relationships"
3. Choose "Segment" and "OK"
4. Drag "Profit" from both sets over to Columns
5. Drag "Segment" from Global Superstore over to Rows

### Blend 

- Used to combine data from different databases that don't support joins
- Data within databases are at different levels of detail
- Joins = duplicate rows
- Involves large amount of data

### Join

Combines data in order to filter and get rid of duplicate content

- Data format is consistent across ALL sources
- Involves small amounts of data
- Data is at the same level of detail across sources
