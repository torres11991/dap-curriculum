## INTRODUCTION:

In this section we'll discuss some of the basic graph types in Tableau, as well as begin a brief discussion on custom calculations.

---

## SCATTER PLOTS

- Used to show the correlation between two measures​ (does not allow dimensions)
- Create magic quadrants and identify the relationships between the measures
- Both axes will must be numerical fields​
- Other fields can be added via [**Color**], [**Size**] or [**Shape​**]

### Example

- Drag [**Sales**] to [**Columns**]
- Drag [**Profit**] to [**Rows**]
- Drag [**Sub-Category**] to [**Detail​**]
- Adjust colors and shapes to your preference using the [**Marks**] pane

<br>

## TREE MAPS

- Display hierarchical items in rectangular boxes consisting of a large rectangle divided up into smaller ones to represent sub-categories

### Example

- Drag [**Region**] to [**Color**]
- Select the marks type as [**Square**] using the [**Marks**] pane
- Drag [**Sales**] to [**Size**]
- Drag [**State**] to [**Detail**] & [**Text**]

<br>

## BUBBLE CHARTS

- The size of the circles denotes the quantity of the metric

### Example

- Drag [**Region**] to [**Color**] & select [**Circle**] for mark type​
- Drag [**Sales**] to [**Size**]​
- Drag [**State**] to [**Detail**] & [**Text**]

<br>

## WORD CLOUDS

- Displays the frequency of words in a text by making the size of each word proportional to its frequency
- Can have meta-data associated with them

### Example

- Drag [**Region**] to [**Color**] & select [**Text**] from the drop-down menu in the [**Marks**] pane​
- Drag [**Sales**] to [**Size**]​
- Drag [**State**] to [**Detail**] & [**Text**]

<br>

## COMBINED AXIS CHARTS

- You can use multiple mark types in the same sheet!​

### Example

- Drag [**Order Date**] to [**Columns**] and select [**Month**] in the Date Value
- Drag [**Sales**] to [**Rows**]​
- Drag [**Profit**] on top of [**Sales**] Axis ON CHART until the two scale symbol appears

<br>

## DUAL AXIS CHARTS

- Consists of two independent axes that are on top of each other​
- Illustrates the relationship between the two variables​
- Used to compare multiple measures of the same category
- Types of charts: ​
  - **Bar vs. line​**
  - **Bar in bar​**
  - **Bar vs. circle​**
  - **Lollipop**
  
### Example

- Drag [**Order Date**] to [**Columns**] (select the set by Date Value to Months)​
- Drag [**Sales**] to [**Rows**]​
- Drag [**Profit**] next to [**Sales**] in [**Rows**]​
- Right-click on [**Profit**] axis & select [**Dual Axis​**]
- Change axis range of Profit, right-click on [**Profit**] and select [**Synchronize Axis​**]
- Change type of Mark for [**Sales**] to bar

<br>

## FUNNEL CHARTS

- Normally used in Marketing & Sales​
- Helps present sales, profit, and revenue at different stages​
- Created for single a measure value and multiple measure value​s

### Example

- Drag [**Sales**] to [**Rows**] and select [**Aggregate Type**] as [**SUM​**]
- Drag [**Region**] to [**Color​**]
- Drag [**SUM(Sales)**] to [**Size**] and sort in descending order​
- Convert [**Standard View**] to [**Entire View​**]
- Add [**Region**] and [**SUM(Sales)**] to [**Label**]

---

## MAPS
---
- Provide more context for the dashboard making it easier for users to spot trends in the data
- There are Symbol Maps and Filled Maps​

### Example

- Drag [**State**] and [**Details**] (notice longitude & Latitude come up automatically)​
- Change [**Marks**] to [**Map​**]
- Drag [**Profit**] to [**Color**]

<br>

## PANNING, ZOOMING & SELECTING​

- At the top left corner of a map there’s a toolbar and search box​
- The toolbar selects marks on the map, pans and zooms in/out​
- To zoom in, select zoom area option and drag to the desired area​
- Zooming creates fixed ranges, click the Pushpin to reset​
- Holding SHIFT, you can drag to move around the map​
- Dashed outline tools can be used to select specific areas on the map

<br>

## USING MAPS TO FILTER

- You can create actions on a map that filter data on a map

<br>

## MAP LAYERING​

- Change the appearance of your map by clicking on [**MAP**] at the top & choosing [**Map Layers**]
- You can also change the background style​
- You can also Hide/Show map layers like land borders, etc.​

<br>

## CREATING CUSTOM TERRITORIES

- A group is created based on the selection of custom territories either manually or by a calculated field

<br>

## MODIFYING LOCATIONS

- Tableau might fail to recognize the location names so you can go in and set them manually

<br>

## GEOCODING

- The process of converting text-based descriptions of a location into coordinates
- Using an external CSV is possible in case Tableau can’t identify the geographical field automatically

<br>

## ADDING A BACKGROUND IMAGE MAKES THE DASHBOARD MORE APPEALING

<br>

## MAP SEARCH

- You can search for a specific location on your map​, including Postal Code, Continent, City, Country & State/Province​
- Located in upper left corner of the GUI

## CALCULATIONS​ IN TABLEAU

---

## BASIC EXPRESSIONS

### LEVELS OF DETAIL

- Powerful functions that alter the level of detail​
- Choices can be made between aggregation & granularity​
- Three different expressions:
  - **include()** - increases aggregation
  - **exclude()** - increases granularity
  - **fixed ()** - increases independence
