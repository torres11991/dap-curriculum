# 4. Python Homework

Create a file and name it 4-Homework (this can be done in a MarkDown file and a Python, or it can be done in a combined Jupyter Notebook file)

<br >

## **Please Answer These Questions:-**

Use a MarkDown file for this section:

1. What does one need to do to use a module?
1. Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code as an example using this module.
1. What is a benefit of using Exception handling?
1. NumPy arrays are like what Python data type?
1. What is one of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays.
1. What is one of the main requirements about the 'dtype' of NumPy arrays?
1. Of the 10 uses of NumPy, name 2.
1. Name one of the other libraries we'll use with NumPy?
1. What is the shape of NumPy arrays?
1. What is a Tensor?
1. Name a reason why it's better using  NumPy for Data Analysis than using a Python List?
1. When creating an "empty" array, where do the elements come from?

<br>

Use a Python code file for this section:

1. Use the DateTime module to get Current Date and Time, and save it to a variable. Then extract just the Full month name form that variable.

2. Write a simple function that takes 2 parameters -- a  first name and a day name.
    - Set a default value for the day name of Sunday.
    - Have the function print out a greeting -- using the parameters -- that says something like "Hi first-name! Happy day-name!". Remember to use the variables in the greeting to replace first-name and day-name.  
    - Invoke this function with 2 variables.
    - Invoke this function with 1 variable only.

3. Import NumPy, use one of the NumPy methods and create an array with a shape of ... (2, 3, 2). You can use the reshape method -- `.reshape()`

4. Use NumPy `.linspace()` to create an array with 6 linearly spaced values between 0 and 20

5. Make a Deep Copy of the above array you created.

6. What are 2 reasons we use NumPy arrays over Python Lists

## When done with homework

When homework has been completed, do the following...

- Make sure your homework file is well named
- Add the homework to your Homework folder
- Use  git add, git commit, and git push to upload your homework changes to GitHub in the cloud
